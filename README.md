# Customer-Churn-Prediction-Analysis

Problem statement :
A random bank has been observing a lot of customers closing their accounts or switching to competitor banks over the past couple of quarters.
As such, this has caused a huge dent in the quarterly revenues and might drastically affect annual revenues for the ongoing financial year, causing stocks to plunge and market cap to reduce.

 Objective:
 Build a model to predict, with a reasonable accuracy, the customers who are going to churn in the near future.

 Definition of churn:
 A customer having closed all their active accounts with the bank is said to have churned.
 A customer not transacting for 6 months or 1 year can also be defined as to have churned, based on the business requirements.
